      Hi, this is Jay!

      - I'm a roboticist and anthropologist by training, and a software engineer by trade.

      - I'm currently building robotics software stuff and exploring Japan life.

      - I use this space to write down my thoughts on human and on technology.

      - You can also get onto Discord and watch whatever I do on my computer ðŸ™ƒ
