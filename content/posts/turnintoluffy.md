So about a month ago, I started building this product [TurnIntoLuffy.com](https://www.turnintoluffy.com). After about 5 months dedicated to learning Japanese and exploring life in Japan, I went back home, and anxiety hit in.

I had to work out my plan after Japan, and to get long-term visa to almost any country, I would need some proof of income. (Exception being Japan/U.K. where I could get J-Find/HPI visas, and Australia/New Zealand with work holiday lottery). Also, man, it does make you insecure when you have no income stream, despite having savings.

I don't intend to work for someone, as not doing this is one of the reasons I quit job in the first place. So, I needed an idea to execute on, and came upon this: Create Fan Request cover page creation tool for One Piece. You send in a description of what you want to be drawn, and I create for you (w/ AI). It is a mimic of the real one that Oda Enricho does in One Piece manga first page every chapter.
