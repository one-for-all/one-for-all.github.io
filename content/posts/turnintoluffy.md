So about a month ago, I started building this product that I call [TurnToLuffy](https://www.turnluffy.com). After about 5 months dedicated to learning Japanese and exploring life in Japan, I went back home, and anxiety hit in.

I had to work out my plan after Japan, and to get long-term visa to almost any country, I would need some proof of income. (Exception being U.K. where I could get HPI, or Australia/New Zealand for work holiday lottery). Also, man, it does make you insecure when you got not income stream, despite savings.

I don't intend to work for someone, as that is one of the reasons I quit job in the first place. So, I needed an idea to execute on, and came upon it: create Fan Request cover page creation tool for One Piece. You send in a description of what you want to be drawn, and I create for you (w/ AI). It is a mimic of the real one that Oda Enricho does on One Piece manga.

Now that this product has been launched (though fairly unsuccessful so far), I will write down what I did. kinda like a review for myself. (to be continued)
