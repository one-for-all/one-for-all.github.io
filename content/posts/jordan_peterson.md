A former colleague introduced Jordan Peterson, a thinker and commentator, to me.
He recommended a video of him discussing, or rather, debating with someone. Me,
being impatient with long videos of any kinds, just picked some highlights to
watch, thanks to Youtube's functionality.

And, he got me grasped. To be honest, I did not have much high of an expectation
before watching. I thought he would be an intelligent and knowledgeable
scholar just like many others. But I found him to be
different, in a very important way. He was honest, brutally honest. And true
honesty requires bravery, more than we might think, especially when presenting in front of
potentially the world. (Or that he has a extremely secure safety net, however, I
doubt anyone would have that when it is a person against a population). He
basically expressed that high agreeableness would be a characteristic that potentially
prevent people from seeking and maintaining senior management roles in
companies, and that females are on average higher on agreeableness. Therefore,
female's lower percentage in senior management could be partially attributed to
that. Now, this could unsetlle some people with inexact language or logic
understanding.

Now, fast forward to now, about 6 months after that. I have been listening to an
audiobook of his, _12 rules for life_. And I would like to share the first 3 that
I have listend to so far. They are provoking, inspiring, and very relating for me.

## Stand up straight with your shoulders back

It could be cultural. I had always felt the necessity to appear humble when I
could, and not to appear confident, unless really necessary. In some senese, in
my mind, **appearing confident** ~= **being an asshole**. And, this
semi-equation _is not
correct_. There is a difference between appearing confident, and being unkind. We
so often confuse the two. Ok, it could be due to that a small number of
extremely confident-appearing people are indeed ruthless people, and that biased
our perception. However, this is no reason for not appearing confident, i.e.
standing up straight with your shoulders back.

On the contrary, there are many reasons for appearing confident. First is that, it
actually **makes** you confident. As some might know, that act of smiling could
actually make you happy. Similar to that, the act of standing up straight could
make you confident. And you know the benefit of **being** confident. Secondly, it
reduces the chance of people thinking lowly of and dismissing you. For better or
worse, people tend to form an impression of someone just from that person's
posture. And we would not want to be dimissed just because we try to appear
humble/small.

## Treat yourself like someone you are responsible for helping

We so often skip meals, sleep late, drink too much and so on. Yet, we would
never allow someone dear and near to us to do the same. In fact, if we imagine
it, when we
feel responsible for someone, we would take care of that person extremely well, sometimes
against their own will. That could partially explain why many moms form a
extremely rigid schedule while having a very demanding job, after getting
divorced. Because they now have to be singularly responsible for taking care of
the kids. When given such a moral responsibility, people show extreme power. I
sincerely believe that.

Yet, who is the No.1 person that we should be
responsible for? Ourselves. Now, whenever you feel lazy, try to imagine that you
are not the agent, but the **agentee**. Take care of yourself.

## Make friends with people who want the best for you

This is where it gets acute, and provoked me to write this blog. I have a
tendency to look out for the people in need of help. We see people in aweful
condition, and immediately jump into trying to help them. However, how
much of that help is real? Help in this situation often takes up the form of
consultation, which might serve no real function other than making the helper
feel good about themselves.

Also, we might surround us with people in aweful conditions, and think that
merely being their friend would constitute a great aid to them. Yet, it could
just be that we are making ourself feel better by looking at and potentially
lightly helping others in worse conditions.

It takes courage to surround ourself with forward-looking
friends. And that would situate us in a much better position for giving real
help to others.
