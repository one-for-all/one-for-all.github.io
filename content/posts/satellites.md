# Satellites

In my favorite manga One Piece, the genius scientist Vegapunk created 6
satellites (or offshoots/clones) because he was too busy with his work. These
satellites can share thoughts and knowledge with each other and with Vegapunk, and each
carries out an aspect of Vegapunk's life.

So I have been thinking about creating some satellites for myself as well. Right
now, I cannot do the total brain sharing, but it is possible to do a certain
level of sharing (which I might write about in a future post). Now another question is what
tasks would I be able to delegate to satellites.

It turns out to be much less than I thought. Below is a list of things that I
did on a day (chronologically):

1. Quick breakfast
   - which I cannot delegate yet
2. Gym while listening to podcasts
   - could have satellites pick podcasts and summarize the contents for me
3. More formal brunch, for which I needed to search for restaurants and look
   up menu and order
   - the searching and ordering part could be done by satellites
4. Shower
5. On the way to school
6. Enjoy the band concert and the festival
7. Friends chat, Izakaya, taking a walk
8. Catching up with a friend

The last few things are either physical or human-relational, which could not be
delegated.

Looking at the above, two satellite roles emerge:

1. Meal planner
2. Knowledge explorer and summarizer

I am going to create a meal planner, since I have indeed been tired of choosing
what I eat everytime.
