長い休みの時、何する？

From Jan 20, I will have a really long vacation until end of March. Feb 10th is the Chinese New Year, so I will go back to China around that time. However, I am unsure when exactly I should go back.

Two options: Feb 3rd (Saturday) and Jan 27th (Saturday).

Going back later means I get more time being in Japan and learning Japanese in the perfect environment. Going back early means I get more time to travel, and possibly do other things.

However, honestly I am not that into traveling. Also, I have just been to Hokkaido, and I will be on a trip after New Year with family. So it feels like too much to insert another trip in between.

But if not traveling, what else should I do? Or should I prioritize learning Japanese.
