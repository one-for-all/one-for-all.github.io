We need a direction to make progress. We need progress to feel well.

It has now been a little less than 4 months since I came to Japan, and there have just been so many things where I can put effort in. First and foremost, learn Japanese. Second, talk to Japanese and non-Japanese people, make friends with them, and maybe have a relationship. These two are not necessarily the same, though they do generally aid each other. Third, travel and have fun.

Friendship. I am very good at getting into friendly terms with people around me, and very motivated to do it, which is probably why I got good at it. I just dislike the feeling of being stranger with someone. On the other hand, I also realized that I am extremely bad at becoming close friends with others, and for that matter, lukewarm about making close friends. It's often when I started to feel lonely that I become aware of the fact that I have few close friends near me.

Also, as you get older and more sophisticated, it would get more difficult to encounter someone with whom you really want to become close friends with.
