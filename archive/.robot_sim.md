A full-fledged version would be a site where people can just log on and run robot simulations with all the tools needed.
And a robot simulation is a virtual environment that mimics how the robot would behave in physical world.

That is the high-level ideal, but I have got to start somewhere, so my preliminary version 1 would be a site that can run a trajectory supplied by the user. I will build it, post it, and gather feedback. Meanwhile, have idea mature along the way as I build.
